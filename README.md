This is the repository of the paper named as "A Column Generation Approach to Solve Ranking Problems". By downloading the "github_column_generation" folder, Ranking-CG and Ranking-CG Prototype models can be employed to rank instances. While the source code for models are located in the scripts folder, a separate Jupiter notebook for each method exists in the folder "notebook_files". The performances of proposed approaches are analyzed on 10 datasets via 10-fold cross validation with 5 repetitions. Except XOR dataset, an experimental dataset created by authors to assess the proposed methods empirically from different aspects, all datasets are publicly available on UCI Machine Learning Repository. On the other hand, data for the created XOR problem is shared in the "xor" folder. To promote the reproducibility, utilized test indices for each dataset are given in the corresponding data folder.
