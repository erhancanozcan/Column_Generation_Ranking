* [Column Generation-based Prototype Learning for Optimizing Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221723008573)


This paper proposes a column generation-based prototype learning approach to optimize AUC. Unlike typical machine learning algorithms, our approach achieves regularization through the proposed column generation strategy. We show the benefits of utilizing our approach over various benchmark algorithms by testing it on 74 datasets.
